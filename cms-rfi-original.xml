            The enactment of the 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 114-255) in 2016 authorized the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), the Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy/Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ASTP/ONC),
            <SU>1</SU>
            <FTREF/>
                and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to implement certain policies to enhance the amount of health data available through digital channels and give patients secure, electronic access to their personal health information. These policies are the building blocks of a digital ecosystem in which patients can view, manage, utilize, and share their health information through digital applications (apps) and other modern solutions. This digital ecosystem could ultimately expand access to personalized health guidance for patients to improve prevention and chronic disease management.

                 On July 29, 2024, notice was posted in the 
                <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                    that ONC would be dually titled to the Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy and Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (89 FR 60903).
            </P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>On January 12, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13813, “Promoting Healthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States” (82 FR 48385), which directed Federal agencies to implement policies that enhance patient access to healthcare data and empower individuals to make informed decisions about their care.</P>
        <P>In 2018, CMS led payers by example and released Blue Button 2.0, its own Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®)-based Patient Access application programming interface (API) with the goal of increasing beneficiary access to their data and improving patient outcomes. This project initiated an ecosystem of patient-facing applications that allowed beneficiaries to authenticate using their Medicare.gov credentials and then to authorize applications to receive their Medicare claims and benefit information. At this time, 75 third-party apps are connected to the Blue Button 2.0 API, giving beneficiaries a variety of services for viewing their health data, sharing their data with digital services, providers, pharmacies, and caregivers, and making decisions related to their healthcare. Currently, Blue Button 2.0 includes Medicare Part A, B, and D claims information, patient demographics, and coverage information. Additionally, in 2019, CMS launched the Data at the Point of Care API pilot to give providers access to claims data for Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) beneficiaries they treat.</P>
        <P>On May 1, 2020, CMS published the “Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Interoperability and Patient Access for MA Organization and Medicaid Managed Care Plans, State Medicaid Agencies, CHIP Agencies and CHIP Managed Care Entities, Issuers of Qualified Health Plans on the Federally-Facilitated Exchanges, and Healthcare Providers” final rule (CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule) (CMS-9115-F) (85 FR 25510). The rule established standards and requirements for payers regulated by CMS to advance interoperability and data exchange throughout the health system and to signal our commitment to the vision set out in the 21st Century Cures Act and Executive Order 13813 to improve quality and accessibility of information that Americans need to make informed healthcare decisions, including data about healthcare prices and outcomes, while minimizing reporting burdens on affected healthcare providers and payers.</P>
        <P>The CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule built on the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, which established the patient's right of access to their protected health information (PHI), including a right to inspect and/or receive a copy of PHI held in designated record sets by covered entities and their business associates as detailed at 45 CFR 164.524. Among other provisions, the 2020 CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule required impacted payers to implement and maintain (Health Level Seven (HL7®) FHIR-based APIs that would allow patients to use an app of their choosing to access PHI held by or on behalf of a HIPAA covered entity.</P>
        <P>On May 1, 2020, ASTP ONC published the “21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health Information Technology (IT) Certification Program” final rule (ONC Cures Act final rule) (85 FR 25642). This final rule strengthened patients' electronic access (including via a third-party app) to their health information at no cost and added a certification criterion under the ONC Health IT Certification Program to support the availability of FHIR-based APIs in electronic health records and other certified health IT to enable patients and providers to view electronic health information using smartphone applications.</P>
        <P>
            Subsequent ASTP/ONC regulations finalized provisions to advance interoperability, enhance health IT certification, and support the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information. Specifically, the ASTP/ONC “Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing” final rule (HTI-1 final rule), which adopted version 3 of the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) standard 
            <SU>2</SU>
            <FTREF/>
                and expanded access to more data via FHIR APIs that meet standards adopted by ASTP/ONC (89 FR 1192); and the “Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement” final rule (HTI-2 final rule), which implemented provisions related to the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement
            <SU>TM</SU>
                (TEFCA
            <SU>TM</SU>
            ) that support information sharing as well as network reliability, privacy, security, and trust (89 FR 101772).

                . The United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) is a standardized set of health data classes and constituent data elements for nationwide, interoperable health information exchange.
            </P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>
            In 2024, CMS published the “Interoperability and Prior Authorization” final rule, which required impacted payers to implement and maintain a Provider Access API, similar to CMS' Data at the Point of Care 
            <PRTPAGE P="21036"/>
            API, to make current patients' claims and encounter data available to in-network or enrolled providers with whom the patient has a verified treatment relationship, at the provider's request (89 FR 8758). The final rule requires impacted payers to be in compliance by January 1, 2027.
        </P>
        <P>The policy framework established by CMS and ASTP/ONC rulemakings are intended to promote the seamless and secure flow of health information between patients, providers, and payers, enabling digital workflows supported by smartphone applications and other modern tools.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Solicitation of Public Comments</HD>
        <P>As the breadth, depth, quality, and timeliness of health data available to patients through standards-based APIs increase, evolving digital health products will gain greater functionality and potential for enhancing the healthcare experience, reducing costs, increasing access to care, enabling chronic disease prevention, and improving healthcare outcomes. Although the building blocks for a patient-centric digital health ecosystem are in place, the experience of most patients, caregivers, and providers is neither seamless nor simple. To get access to their data, patients have to track which providers they have seen and set up separate accounts and credentials with each portal. Even for patients who are able to set this up, digital products for health management or care navigation that can leverage patient health records are still rare; appointment scheduling often still entails lengthy phone calls and provider intake still involves clipboards of multiple forms.</P>
        <P>CMS and ASTP/ONC would like to continue to build on the existing policy framework to drive large-scale adoption of health management and care navigation applications, reduce barriers to data access and exchange, realize the potential of recent innovations in healthcare that promote better health outcomes, and accelerate progress towards a patient-centric learning health system.  </P>
        <P>CMS and ASTP/ONC seek feedback from stakeholders, including but not limited to: patients and caregivers, providers, payers, health IT companies, health information exchanges, health information networks, clearinghouses, researchers, and developers of digital health products regarding how we can help achieve the potential of digital health technology. CMS and ASTP/ONC also seek feedback on which elements of today's digital health ecosystem are working, which are working inconsistently and need improvement, and which are impeding rapid progress. CMS and ASTP/ONC also seek input for possible consideration in future rulemaking on policies to ease health data exchange and promote innovation in consumer digital health products, and how HHS can encourage patient, caregiver, and provider engagement with digital health products.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the transition to value-based care (VBC) represents a cornerstone of CMS' strategy to incentivize improvements in health outcomes rather than increases in service volume. The role of technology is critical to this transformation. While significant progress has been made in health IT adoption, opportunities remain to better align technology requirements with the needs of providers participating in Alternative Payment Models (APMs) and other value-based care programs. Among other topics, CMS and ASTP/ONC seek feedback on current HHS requirements around the use of technology, including the use of health IT certified under the ONC Health IT Certification Program, by healthcare providers participating in VBC initiatives. Among other areas of inquiry, CMS and ASTP/ONC request input on requirements for the use of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology (CEHRT), and how such requirements can enable value-based care and meet statutory requirements while meeting other program objectives, such as reducing provider burden, to better support value-based care adoption among providers, and subsequently improve patient choice and competition in the healthcare marketplace.</P>
        <P>The questions that follow are grouped by use cases corresponding to patients and caregivers, providers, payers, technology vendors and data providers, and VBC organizations. We encourage patient advocates and healthcare stakeholders to share their feedback for as many of these use cases as possible. The questions are not meant to be directed to a specific audience but are meant to solicit feedback from multiple types of stakeholders for each use case as appropriate. To aid understanding of submitted responses, please prioritize clarity and conciseness and annotate your responses with question label(s) (for example, PC-1).</P>
        <P>Because we expect some responses to relate to software workflows that may be difficult to fully articulate in written responses, we welcome links to screenshots or brief video demonstrations as part of submitted feedback. Please keep videos to a maximum of 15 minutes total to highlight real-world challenges, workflow examples, or functional capabilities and keep introduction of the presenters and company to no more than 2 minutes.</P>

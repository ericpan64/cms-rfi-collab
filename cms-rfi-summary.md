# Detailed Breakdown of the RFI

## I. Background
CMS and ASTP/ONC trace their authority to the 21st Century Cures Act (2016) and Executive Order 13813 (2017). Key milestones include Blue Button 2.0 (2018), the Data at the Point of Care API pilot (2019), the 2020 Interoperability & Patient Access and ONC Cures Act final rules, HTI-1 and HTI-2 updates, and the 2024 Prior Authorization final rule—establishing standards-based FHIR APIs, USCDI, and TEFCA to enable secure data access and spur innovation.

## II. Solicitation of Public Comments

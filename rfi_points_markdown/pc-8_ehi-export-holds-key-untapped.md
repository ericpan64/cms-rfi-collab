summary: "The EHI Export capability, mandated by ONC, is the regulatory mechanism intended to provide access to this comprehensive 'hard to access' data. However, its current predominantly manual, non-standardized, and portal-centric retrieval methods render it largely inaccessible for systematic digital use by patients or their chosen applications."

The Electronic Health Information (EHI) Export capability, as defined and mandated by ONC's certification criteria (ยง 170.315(b)(10)), is the primary regulatory mechanism intended to ensure patients can access their *complete* EHI, including the "hard to access" data types mentioned previously (notes, non-USCDI elements, historical data, etc.).

However, the current implementation of EHI Export by most Health IT developers relies on:
*   **Manual initiation:** Often requiring navigation through a patient portal.
*   **Non-standardized formats:** While documentation is required, the actual structure of the export can vary significantly.
*   **Lack of API-driven retrieval:** Patients typically download a file; their applications cannot programmatically request or ingest this data.
These characteristics render the EHI Export largely inaccessible and unusable for systematic, automated digital use by patients or their chosen third-party applications, severely limiting its value for unlocking comprehensive data.

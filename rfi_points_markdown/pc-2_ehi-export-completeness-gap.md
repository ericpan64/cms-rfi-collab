The majority of a patient's comprehensive health story—including critical unstructured notes, historical data not mapped to USCDI, non-standardized flowsheets, and full imaging reports—is often only available via a full EHI Export. Current EHI Export processes are predominantly manual, cumbersome, highly variable between systems, and lack digital integration, creating significant barriers to patients and their apps accessing their complete information.

short_title: "EHI Export Completeness Gap"
summary: "The majority of a patient's comprehensive health story—including critical unstructured notes, historical data not mapped to USCDI, non-standardized flowsheets, and full imaging reports—is often only available via a full EHI Export. Current EHI Export processes are predominantly manual, cumbersome, and lack digital integration, creating significant access barriers."

The majority of a patient's comprehensive health story, which includes clinically vital information beyond the scope of USCDI, is often only contained within the full Electronic Health Information (EHI) that certified EHRs are capable of exporting. This includes:
*   Critical unstructured provider notes (progress notes, consultation reports, discharge summaries).
*   Historical data that predates consistent USCDI adoption or was never mapped.
*   Non-standardized but clinically relevant flowsheet data.
*   Full narrative imaging reports and potentially links to images themselves.
Currently, accessing this complete EHI via the "EHI Export" capability is typically a manual, cumbersome process, highly variable between EHR systems, and generally lacks any standardized digital integration pathway for patients or their applications. This creates significant barriers to patients obtaining and utilizing their complete health information.

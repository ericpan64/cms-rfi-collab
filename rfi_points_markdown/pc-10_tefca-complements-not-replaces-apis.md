TEFCA should be positioned as a complementary exchange mechanism. It should not supplant or be mandated as the *sole* or *prioritized* manner of access if direct, certified FHIR APIs (e.g., from EHRs) can meet a specific access need more efficiently, with greater patient control, or with better performance.

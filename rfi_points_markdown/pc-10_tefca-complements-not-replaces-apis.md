summary: "TEFCA should be positioned as a complementary exchange mechanism. It should not supplant or be mandated as the sole or prioritized manner of access if direct, certified FHIR APIs (e.g., from EHRs) can meet a specific access need more efficiently, with greater patient control, or with better performance for individual data access."

TEFCA should be positioned and implemented as a complementary exchange mechanism within the broader health data ecosystem. It should *not* supplant or be mandated as the *sole* or *prioritized* manner of access if direct, certified FHIR APIs (such as those provided by EHRs under ONC certification) can meet a specific patient or provider access need more efficiently, with more granular patient control, or with superior performance, especially for an individual accessing their own data. Patients and their authorized applications should have the flexibility to choose the most appropriate and effective pathway for data access based on the specific use case and available options. Forcing all access through TEFCA when a more direct, performant certified API is available could introduce unnecessary complexity or limitations for individual users.

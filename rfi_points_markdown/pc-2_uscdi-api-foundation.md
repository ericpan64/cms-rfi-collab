The United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI), made accessible through HL7 FHIR APIs as mandated by ONC regulations, provides a crucial and standardized foundation for accessing core health data elements. This structured data is essential for a wide range of patient-facing applications, enabling functionalities like data aggregation, basic health tracking, and sharing with providers. However, it is important to recognize that USCDI, by design, represents only a *subset* of the complete health information typically stored within a patient's Electronic Health Record (EHR).

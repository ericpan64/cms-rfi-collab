short_title: "TEFCA: Patient Control & Transparency over B2B Exchange"
summary: "To build trust, TEFCA must provide patients with mechanisms for transparency and control over network exchanges happening *about them* under existing permitted purposes (e.g., TPO), even without their direct, instance-specific consent. This includes robust audit logs, and capabilities like 'Ask Me First' notifications or 'Freeze' options for B2B data sharing."

While TEFCA facilitates data exchange for permitted purposes like Treatment, Payment, and Operations (TPO) which may not require instance-specific patient consent, it is imperative for patient trust and empowerment that individuals have transparency into and meaningful control over such Business-to-Business (B2B) exchanges occurring *about them* through the network. TEFCA must therefore mandate:

1.  **Comprehensive Patient-Accessible Audit Logs:** (Reaffirming PC10-FUTURE_STATE_TEFCA_PATIENT_AUDIT_MANDATE) Patients must have easy access to clear, understandable audit logs of *all* queries for and exchanges of their data via TEFCA, detailing who accessed what, when, and for what stated purpose, regardless of the consent model.

2.  **Proactive Control Mechanisms for B2B Exchange:** Beyond retrospective audits, patients should have proactive controls, potentially managed via a TEFCA-wide preference service or through their QHIN:
    *   **"Ask Me First" for TPO Queries (Optional Patient Preference):** An option for patients to request notification and require their explicit approval *before* their data is shared in response to certain categories of B2B queries (e.g., non-emergency treatment queries from a new provider). This would be a patient-configurable preference.
    *   **Simple "Freeze" or Opt-Out of B2B Exchange:** A straightforward method for patients to temporarily "freeze" or opt-out of having their data shared via TEFCA for specific B2B purposes or with specific entities, where permissible by law and TEFCA policy. This would need careful consideration of impact on care but should be explored for non-critical exchanges.

These mechanisms would provide patients with a greater sense of agency and control over how their information flows through the TEFCA network, even for exchanges not directly initiated or authorized by them instance-by-instance. This is crucial for building public trust in nationwide health information exchange.

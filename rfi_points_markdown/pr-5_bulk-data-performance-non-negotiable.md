Stress the absolute necessity for *highly performant and reliable* Bulk FHIR (Standardized API for P\&PS) for population health, quality reporting, VBC, and research. This includes effective Group ID filtering and adherence to clear performance benchmarks (see MedRxiv paper on current, often inadequate, performance).

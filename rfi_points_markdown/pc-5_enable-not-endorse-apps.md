summary: "CMS's primary role should be to establish and enforce a robust, secure, and highly performant data infrastructure (APIs, automated EHI Export), empowering patient choice of apps from a competitive market. CMS should not directly approve apps for efficacy, but could ensure baseline security, privacy, and transparency standards for connection."

CMS's primary and most impactful role in encouraging patient and caregiver interest in digital health products is to *establish and vigorously enforce a robust, secure, and highly performant data infrastructure*. This includes ensuring universal availability and reliability of:
*   Standardized APIs for USCDI and richer datasets.
*   Performant Bulk Data APIs.
*   Automated, API-driven EHI Export mechanisms.

By ensuring the foundational data pipes work exceptionally well, CMS empowers patients to choose applications that meet their specific needs from a vibrant, competitive market. CMS should generally *not* be in the business of directly reviewing or approving digital health products based on their clinical efficacy or quality, as this could stifle innovation and create bottlenecks. However, CMS could play a role in setting or recognizing baseline security, privacy (e.g., attestation to a code of conduct like the CARIN Alliance Code), and transparency standards that apps must meet to connect to CMS-regulated data sources or participate in CMS-facilitated ecosystems.

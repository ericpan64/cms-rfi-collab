CMS's primary role should be to establish and enforce a robust, secure, and *highly performant* data infrastructure (APIs, automated EHI Export). This empowers patients to choose apps that meet their needs from a competitive market, rather than CMS directly approving apps for efficacy. Any CMS "review" should be limited to ensuring apps meet baseline security, privacy (e.g., attestation to a code of conduct), and transparency standards for connection.

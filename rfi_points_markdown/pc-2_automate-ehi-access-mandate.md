It is imperative to mandate standardized, API-driven mechanisms for patients (or their authorized applications) to electronically *request, monitor the status of, and securely receive* their complete EHI Export. This process must be digital end-to-end, eliminating out-of-band phone calls, faxes, or custom portal-only hoops. The exported EHI must be in a documented, computable format.

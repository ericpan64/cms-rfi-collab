To bridge the gap between USCDI-only API access and the need for comprehensive health data, it is imperative to *mandate standardized, API-driven mechanisms* for patients (or their duly authorized applications, leveraging trusted identity and authorization frameworks) to:
1.  Electronically and programmatically *request* their complete EHI Export from a certified Health IT Module.
2.  Electronically and programmatically *monitor the status* of this export generation process (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed, failed).
3.  Securely and programmatically *receive or download* the complete EHI Export package once it is ready.
This entire process must be digital end-to-end, eliminating reliance on out-of-band methods like phone calls, faxes, or custom portal-only workflows that are not accessible to third-party applications. The exported EHI itself must be provided in a documented, computable format to be truly useful.

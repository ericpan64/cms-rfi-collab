The ultimate goal for patient data access should be to empower patients to use applications of their choice that can act as a "single access point" for their health information. These applications should be able to seamlessly:
1.  Aggregate standardized core data obtained via USCDI FHIR APIs from various providers.
2.  Integrate and incorporate the richer, more comprehensive data obtained via patient-initiated, API-driven EHI Exports.
This combination will allow for a truly comprehensive, longitudinal view of a patient's health record, managed by the patient, and usable by innovative applications to support their health and healthcare decisions.

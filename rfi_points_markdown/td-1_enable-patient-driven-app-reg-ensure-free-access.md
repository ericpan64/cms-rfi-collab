To ensure equitable access and encourage broad adoption of digital health products by Medicare beneficiaries and caregivers, it must be an explicit and enforced policy that:
*Individual patients accessing their own health information through mandated mechanisms—whether via direct ONC-certified EHR APIs or through **TEFCA-facilitated individual access pathways**—using an application they have personally authorized, shall not incur any data access fees.*
This prohibition on fees for personal data access should apply to data holders (e.g., healthcare providers, EHR vendors hosting data) and any network operators (e.g., QHINs supporting individual access pathways). Cost must not be a barrier for individuals to use their data with tools of their choice. This principle is fundamental to the "no special effort" provision of the Cures Act.

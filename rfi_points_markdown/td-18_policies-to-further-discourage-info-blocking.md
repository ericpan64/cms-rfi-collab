summary: "To further discourage information blocking by healthcare providers (and other actors), ASTP/ONC and CMS could: explicitly link API and EHI Export performance/completeness failures to information blocking in guidance; conduct proactive audits or 'mystery shopper' testing of certified API implementations; strengthen and clarify disincentives for all categories of actors; and further streamline the complaint reporting and investigation process."

To further discourage healthcare providers (and other actors like Health IT developers and HIEs/HINs) from engaging in information blocking practices, ASTP/ONC and CMS could implement the following additional policies:

1.  **Explicitly Link Performance and Completeness to Information Blocking:** Issue clear guidance stating that failure to meet established API performance benchmarks (for Patient Access, Bulk Data), failure to provide timely and complete (all EHI) automated EHI Exports, or failure to support patient-directed dynamic app registration without undue friction can be considered practices that interfere with EHI access and may constitute information blocking, absent a valid exception.

2.  **Proactive Audits and "Mystery Shopper" Testing:**
    *   ONC could consider mechanisms for proactive auditing or "mystery shopper" style testing of certified API implementations and EHI Export capabilities in production environments to identify systemic issues or potential information blocking practices, rather than relying solely on complaints.
    *   CMS could incorporate checks for data accessibility practices into its program oversight.

3.  **Strengthen and Clarify Disincentives for All Actors:**
    *   Ensure that disincentives for information blocking are substantial, consistently applied, and effectively deter non-compliance across all categories of actors defined in the Cures Act.
    *   Address any gaps where specific categories of actors (as per TD-18c) may currently lack clear or impactful disincentives.

4.  **Streamline Complaint Reporting and Investigation:**
    *   Continue to enhance the accessibility and user-friendliness of ONC's Information Blocking Portal for submitting complaints.
    *   Ensure timely investigation and transparent (where appropriate) resolution and reporting of complaints to build confidence in the enforcement process.

5.  **Increased Education and Outreach:** Provide targeted education to all actor categories about their responsibilities under the information blocking regulations, with clear examples of compliant and non-compliant practices, especially regarding new technology mandates like API-driven EHI export or patient-directed app registration.

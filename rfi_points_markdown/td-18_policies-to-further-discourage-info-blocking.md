Additional policies could include:
*   Explicitly Link Performance to Info Blocking: Clarify in guidance that failure to meet established API performance benchmarks or to provide timely automated EHI Export can be considered information blocking.
*   Proactive Audits & Testing: ONC and CMS could consider proactive auditing or "mystery shopper" style testing of certified API implementations to identify potential information blocking practices.
*   Strengthen Disincentives: Ensure that disincentives for information blocking are substantial and apply effectively across all categories of actors, including those not currently covered by specific CMS disincentive programs.
*   Streamline Complaint Reporting and Investigation: Make the Information Blocking Portal even more accessible and ensure timely investigation and transparent resolution of complaints.

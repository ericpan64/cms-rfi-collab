The United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) serves as an **essential, standardized *core* dataset**. Its establishment and iterative expansion (e.g., to USCDI v3, v4) have significantly advanced baseline interoperability across the nation by defining a common set of health data classes and constituent data elements that all certified Health IT should support for exchange. This provides a reliable data foundation for many applications and use cases.

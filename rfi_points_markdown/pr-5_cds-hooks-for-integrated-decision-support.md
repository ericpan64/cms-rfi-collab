CDS Hooks represent a mature and highly valuable HL7 standard for integrating external clinical decision support (CDS) services directly into EHR clinical workflows. Support for CDS Hooks (specifically version 2.0 with mandatory `patient-view` hook, prefetch of US Core data, and `fhirAuthorization`) should be strongly encouraged and maintained in certification as an alternative to older technologies like InfoButton. This capability allows for:
*   **Improved Provider Efficiency:** Timely, context-relevant guidance at the point of care.
*   **Enhanced Care Quality:** Easier adoption of evidence-based practices and complex guidelines.
*   **Innovation in AI:** A standardized way to integrate AI-driven recommendations and insights into EHRs.
Robust CDS Hooks support is a key enabler for a more intelligent and responsive healthcare ecosystem.

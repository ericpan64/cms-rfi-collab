Mandate Identity-Scoped Dynamic Application Registration: Patients, using their trusted digital identity credential, must be empowered to dynamically register *any application of their choosing*—including self-developed tools or niche third-party apps—with all ONC-certified Health IT Modules (primarily EHRs) and with QHINs (for TEFCA Individual Access Services \- IAS). This registration process must programmatically restrict the application's operational scope to act *only on behalf of that specific, authenticated patient*. The application itself does not require extensive pre-vetting or business-level agreements if its access is strictly governed by an authenticated patient's explicit, ongoing consent managed through a trusted authorization service. This is foundational for true permissionless innovation by individuals.

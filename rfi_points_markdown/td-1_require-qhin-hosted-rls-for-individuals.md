QHINs participating in TEFCA must be required to offer a standardized, API-accessible Record Locator Service (RLS). This RLS must be available to individuals (via their authorized and dynamically registered applications, as described above) to discover which healthcare organizations across the TEFCA network hold their health records. This "discovery" step is essential before granular data retrieval can be effectively initiated.

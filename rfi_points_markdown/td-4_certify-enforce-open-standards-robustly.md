short_title: "Certify & Enforce Open Standards Robustly"
summary: "CMS should encourage use of open, standards-based APIs by continuing to mandate them (FHIR, Bulk Data, CDS Hooks, SMART, and a future standardized EHI Export API) via ONC Certification. Crucially, certification must be significantly strengthened to ensure these standards are implemented not just as a checkbox, but are performant, complete, reliable, and fully support the required patient-driven registration and access models."

CMS can best encourage the use of open, standards-based, publicly available APIs over proprietary APIs by:
1.  **Continuing to Mandate Open Standards through ONC Certification:** Ensure that core interoperability requirements leverage open standards such as HL7 FHIR (for USCDI and richer data access), FHIR Bulk Data Access, CDS Hooks, SMART on FHIR (including standalone launch and robust security like SMART 2.1), and a future standardized API for EHI Export.
2.  **Significantly Strengthening Certification and Enforcement:** The ONC Health IT Certification Program must evolve to ensure that these mandated open standards are implemented not merely as a superficial "checkbox" to pass certification, but in a manner that is:
    *   **Performant:** Meeting defined benchmarks for speed and reliability.
    *   **Complete:** Providing access to all required data without arbitrary omissions.
    *   **Reliable:** Consistently available and functioning as specified.
    *   **Supportive of Patient-Driven Models:** Fully enabling dynamic app registration by individuals and respecting granular, patient-managed consent.
Proprietary APIs persist when open standards are poorly implemented or offer inadequate functionality. Robust, well-enforced open standards level the playing field.

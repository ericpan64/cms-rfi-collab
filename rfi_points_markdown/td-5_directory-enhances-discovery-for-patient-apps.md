A reliable, comprehensive, and publicly accessible nationwide provider directory containing validated FHIR server base URLs would significantly improve access to health information. For patients and their authorized applications, such a directory is essential for:
*   **Discovering direct EHR FHIR endpoints:** For connecting to providers for Patient Access APIs as mandated by ONC.
*   **Navigating TEFCA:** The directory could also list TEFCA QHIN affiliation and potentially participant-level connection information, aiding in understanding how a provider might be reached via the TEFCA network.
This directory would simplify a major hurdle for app developers and reduce the friction patients experience when trying to connect their apps to different providers, whether directly or through networks like TEFCA.

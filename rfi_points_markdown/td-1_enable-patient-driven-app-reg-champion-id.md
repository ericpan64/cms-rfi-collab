To stimulate developer interest by ensuring a secure and reliable way for patients to authorize apps, CMS should actively champion and, where appropriate, facilitate the widespread availability and adoption of trusted digital identity credentials for patients. These credentials must be:
*   **Widely Accepted:** Interoperable across different systems and applications.
*   **Free-to-Patient:** Ensuring no cost barrier for individuals.
*   **High-Assurance:** Meeting NIST Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) and Authenticator Assurance Level 2 (AAL2) or equivalent standards.

Potential pathways include:
*   Enhancing and promoting Login.gov for healthcare use cases.
*   Formally recognizing and fostering interoperability for state-issued mobile Driver's Licenses (mDLs) under a common national profile.
*   Supporting the development and adoption of other open standards-based Verifiable Credential solutions.
A robust, trusted identity layer is the bedrock for secure patient-mediated data access and subsequent developer innovation.

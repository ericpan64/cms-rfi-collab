Champion Trusted Patient Identity Credentials: CMS should actively promote, and where appropriate, facilitate the availability and adoption of a widely accepted, free-to-patient, high-assurance (NIST IAL2/AAL2) digital identity credential. This could involve enhancing Login.gov, formally recognizing state-issued mobile Driver's Licenses (mDLs) under a common interoperable profile, or supporting other verifiable credential solutions.

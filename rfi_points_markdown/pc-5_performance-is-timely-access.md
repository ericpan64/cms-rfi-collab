Timely, high-quality data access fundamentally depends on performance API access. This means mandating and *certifying for actual performance* all key APIs (USCDI, Bulk Data) and the new automated EHI Export retrieval mechanisms. Ensuring performant access will require setting clear benchmarks (e.g., comparable to proprietary exports; ability to export entire active patient populations within a defined, reasonable timeframe).

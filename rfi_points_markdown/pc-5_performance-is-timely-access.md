summary: "Timely access to high-quality CMS and provider-generated data depends fundamentally on mandating and certifying for *actual performance* all key data access APIs (USCDI, Bulk Data) and the new automated EHI Export retrieval mechanisms. Clear performance benchmarks are essential."

Changes that would enable timely access to high-quality CMS and provider-generated data hinge on *API and data export performance*. Policy and certification must ensure that:
*   All key data access mechanisms—USCDI FHIR APIs, Bulk Data FHIR APIs, and the proposed API-driven EHI Export—are not just implemented, but are *highly performant and reliable*.
*   ONC certification includes stringent, real-world performance testing against clear benchmarks. For instance, Bulk Data export speeds from certified EHRs should be comparable to proprietary data warehouse exports, and systems should demonstrate the ability to export entire active patient populations within a defined, reasonable timeframe (e.g., 5 days, as suggested in prior analysis).
Sub-par performance effectively denies timely access and undermines the utility of digital health products.

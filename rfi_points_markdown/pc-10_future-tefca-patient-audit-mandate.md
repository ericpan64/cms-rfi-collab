To significantly advance patient access, build trust, and ensure accountability within the TEFCA framework, it is imperative that **the TEFCA framework require participating QHINs** to provide patients with a clear, easily accessible, and understandable audit log. This log must detail all queries for and exchanges of their data facilitated through the TEFCA network. Key elements of this audit log should include:
*   Who (which entity and, where appropriate, individual user type) queried or received the data.
*   What data (e.g., specific USCDI classes, or indication of broader exchange) was involved.
*   When the query or exchange occurred.
*   The stated purpose of use for the query or exchange.
This capability is fundamental to realizing patient sovereignty over their health information and must be a core tenet of TEFCA operations.

To ensure widespread adoption, reduce fragmentation, and enhance patient control across the entire digital health ecosystem, CMS and ONC should advocate for and support the national adoption of:
*   **Standards-based, interoperable digital identity solutions:** This includes leveraging emerging technologies like state-issued mobile Driver's Licenses (mDLs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), as well as established high-assurance services like Login.gov, all adhering to common profiles for interoperability.
*   **Standardized authorization protocols:** These identity solutions must be tightly integrated with standardized authorization frameworks such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. Furthermore, the specifics of healthcare data sharing consent should be managed using standards like FHIR Consent resources, ensuring that permissions are granular, understandable, and programmatically enforceable.
This combination will enable patients to use a consistent set of trusted credentials and consent mechanisms across various applications, data sources, and critically, patient portals, thereby reducing the burden of managing numerous bespoke login credentials.

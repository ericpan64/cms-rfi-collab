USCDI data via FHIR APIs is valuable and increasingly available for structured, core data elements. However, it frequently omits critical contextual information (e.g., detailed provider notes, non-standardized but clinically relevant data, complete historical records before USCDI adoption, full imaging narratives) which remains very hard for patients and app developers to access programmatically today.

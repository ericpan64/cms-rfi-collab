short_title: "Certification: Validate Real-World Usability, Not Checkboxes"
summary: "To support providers, ONC certification must evolve to rigorously validate real-world usability, actual API performance, and data completeness for both direct APIs (USCDI, Bulk Data) and automated EHI Export mechanisms. Current checkbox compliance is insufficient for ensuring providers have truly functional tools."

To effectively support providers in making high-quality, timely, and comprehensive healthcare data available for interoperability, ONC's Health IT Certification Program must evolve beyond verifying the mere presence of features ("checkbox compliance"). Instead, certification must rigorously validate:
*   **Real-World Usability:** Ensuring that certified functionalities are implemented in a way that is practical and efficient for end-users (providers and patients).
*   **Actual API Performance:** Testing APIs (USCDI Patient Access, Bulk Data) against realistic scenarios and defined performance benchmarks to ensure they are responsive and reliable.
*   **Data Completeness:** Verifying that systems can indeed provide access to all EHI, whether through direct APIs for standardized data or through a functional, automatable EHI Export mechanism for comprehensive data.
Without this focus on real-world functionality, providers are often left with certified tools that are technically compliant but practically deficient, increasing rather than mitigating burden.

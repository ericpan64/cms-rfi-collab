(Reiteration for emphasis in the context of stimulating developer interest) A crucial short-term step that CMS and ONC can take to unlock comprehensive data necessary for many innovative digital health products for Medicare beneficiaries is to *standardize and mandate an API-driven method for EHI Export*.
This means requiring certified Health IT to expose an API that allows a patient (or their authorized application) to:
1.  Programmatically request their full EHI Export.
2.  Programmatically monitor the status of the export's generation.
3.  Programmatically and securely download the complete EHI Export.
This will make the "long tail" of patient data practically accessible to developers, significantly expanding the potential scope and value of applications they can build.

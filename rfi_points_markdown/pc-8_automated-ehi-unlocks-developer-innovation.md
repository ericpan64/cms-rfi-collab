Transforming the EHI Export capability into a *standardized, API-driven process*—where a patient or their authorized application can programmatically request the export, monitor its generation status, and securely retrieve the complete, computable data package—would be a game-changer.

This modernization would unlock the rich, comprehensive dataset currently trapped within EHRs. It would enable developers, including individual innovators and commercial entities, to build:
*   **More comprehensive Personal Health Records (PHRs).**
*   **Context-aware decision support tools** that leverage the full patient narrative.
*   **Advanced analytics and AI-driven insights** based on a more complete dataset.
*   **Clinically valuable patient-facing services** that can offer more personalized and effective support by utilizing data beyond the current scope of USCDI APIs.
This is a critical step for fostering a truly innovative ecosystem around patient data.

summary: "TEFCA's direct impact on empowering individual patients with access, audit, and control through its current implementation appears limited. Its initial focus has been predominantly on Business-to-Business (B2B) exchange, rather than ensuring robust, low-barrier pathways for individuals to access their own data using tools of their choice via the network."

To date, TEFCA's direct, tangible impact on empowering *individual patients* with enhanced access to their comprehensive health information, transparent audit logs of data exchanges, and granular control over how their data is shared network-wide appears limited. The initial rollout and current operational focus of TEFCA have largely centered on facilitating Business-to-Business (B2B) data exchange between healthcare entities. There is a need to prioritize and clearly define robust, low-barrier pathways within the TEFCA framework that enable individuals to directly access their own data using tools of their choice via the network, independent of more formal "Individual Access Services" participant roles.

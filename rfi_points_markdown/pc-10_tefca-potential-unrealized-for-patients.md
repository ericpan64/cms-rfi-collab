To date, TEFCA's direct, tangible impact on empowering *individual patients* with enhanced access to their comprehensive health information, transparent audit logs of data exchanges, and granular control over how their data is shared network-wide appears limited. The initial rollout and current operational focus of TEFCA have largely centered on facilitating Business-to-Business (B2B) data exchange between healthcare entities, rather than prioritizing the development and deployment of robust, user-friendly Individual Access Services (IAS) that would directly benefit patients and their chosen applications.

summary: "CMS and ONC should actively use Information Blocking enforcement and refine certification criteria to penalize practices by Health IT developers or data holders that favor proprietary lock-in. This includes creating 'special effort' (e.g., performance degradation, cumbersome workflows, excessive fees) for using standardized APIs, or impeding the connection of patient-authorized applications to certified open interfaces."

CMS and ONC should aggressively disincentivize reliance on proprietary APIs and vendor lock-in by:
1.  **Leveraging Information Blocking Enforcement:** Actively investigate and penalize practices where Health IT developers or data holders:
    *   Create "special effort" to use mandated open, standards-based APIs (e.g., through poor performance, unreliable availability, lack of clear documentation, excessive or discriminatory fees specifically for certified API use).
    *   Prioritize or offer superior functionality/performance only through proprietary APIs when a certified open standard is available for the same purpose.
    *   Impede or create undue friction for the connection of patient-authorized applications (especially those dynamically registered by individuals) to certified open interfaces.
2.  **Refining Certification Criteria:** Ensure that certification explicitly prohibits such discriminatory practices and requires that open APIs are treated as first-class citizens with full functionality and performance.
A strong stance against practices that perpetuate proprietary siloes is essential for fostering a truly open and competitive ecosystem.

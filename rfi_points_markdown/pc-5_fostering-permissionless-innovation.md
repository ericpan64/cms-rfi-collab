A key driver for patient interest is a vibrant ecosystem of useful apps. While businesses can and should offer commercial products, it is critical to also enable patients and hobbyist developers to easily register and connect their *own self-developed apps* to access *their own data* via certified EHR APIs and network frameworks, free of charge. This principle of permissionless innovation for individuals will naturally lead to more useful and engaging products.

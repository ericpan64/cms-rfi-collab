summary: "Consistent and robust enforcement of Information Blocking rules, especially concerning practices that impede API performance, delay or obstruct EHI Export completeness, or create undue friction for patient-authorized app access, is essential. This creates a level playing field and ensures providers have functional, interoperable tools as intended by law."

To further support providers and mitigate their burden, consistent and robust enforcement of the Information Blocking provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act is essential. Particular attention should be paid to practices by Health IT developers or other actors that:
*   **Impede API Performance:** Providing certified APIs (Patient Access, Bulk Data) that are unreasonably slow, unreliable, or frequently unavailable.
*   **Delay or Obstruct EHI Export:** Making the EHI Export process unnecessarily cumbersome, failing to provide complete EHI, or imposing unreasonable delays.
*   **Create Undue Friction for Patient-Authorized App Access:** Obstructing dynamic registration or connection of apps that patients have authorized to access their data.

Strong enforcement creates a level playing field, ensures that providers (and patients) have functional, interoperable tools as intended by the Cures Act, and discourages practices that shift the burden of poor system design or performance onto providers.

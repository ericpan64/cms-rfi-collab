Successful VBC program implementation is profoundly hindered by interoperability challenges. These include:
*   Lack of timely access to comprehensive patient data from disparate sources.
*   Inadequate performance and reliability of Bulk Data APIs for population-level analytics and risk stratification.
*   Difficulty obtaining complete patient histories (the "long tail" of data often outside USCDI) needed for accurate risk assessment and care coordination, which an AUTOMATED\_EHI\_ACCESS\_MANDATE would help address.

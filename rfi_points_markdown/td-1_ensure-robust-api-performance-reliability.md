(Reiteration) The entire model of patient-driven access and developer innovation hinges on the availability of *highly performant, reliable, and well-documented APIs* (for USCDI, Bulk Data, and the newly proposed automated EHI Export API) across all certified systems. Sub-par performance is a critical barrier to adoption and utility.

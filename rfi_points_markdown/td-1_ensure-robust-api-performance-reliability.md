summary: "Patient-driven access and subsequent developer innovation for Medicare beneficiaries critically depend on the universal availability of highly performant, reliable, and well-documented APIs (for USCDI, Bulk Data, and the proposed automated EHI Export API) across all certified systems. Sub-par performance is a significant barrier to developer interest and app utility."

(Reiteration for emphasis in the context of stimulating developer interest) The entire model of patient-driven data access, which underpins the ability of developers to create useful digital health products for Medicare beneficiaries, hinges on the *universal availability of highly performant, reliable, and well-documented APIs* across all certified Health IT systems. This includes:
*   APIs for USCDI access.
*   Bulk Data APIs.
*   The proposed standardized, API-driven EHI Export mechanism.

If these foundational data access pathways are slow, error-prone, or inconsistently implemented, developer interest will wane, and the potential for innovative applications will remain unrealized. Sub-par API performance is a critical barrier that CMS and ONC must address through stringent certification and enforcement.

The EHI Export (especially an API-driven one) remains critical for accessing the vast amount of EHI not yet covered by USCDI or common FHIR profiles. While LLMs can process text, a documented, computable EHI export is vital for applications that need to reliably extract and use specific information not yet in discrete FHIR resources.

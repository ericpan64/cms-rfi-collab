Emphatically, yes. ONC *must* revise the EHI Export certification criterion (§ 170.315(b)(10)) to require a specific, standardized, FHIR-based API operation. This API must enable a patient (or their duly authorized application, leveraging the trusted identity/authorization framework) to:
*   Electronically and programmatically *request* the EHI Export for that single patient.
*   Electronically and programmatically *monitor the status* of the export generation process (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed, failed).
*   Securely and programmatically *download* the complete EHI Export package once it is ready. This critical change will transform EHI Export from its current state—often a manual, opaque, and inconsistently implemented process—into an integrated, automatable, and genuinely useful component of the patient data access ecosystem, vital for comprehensive data aggregation and innovation.

It is essential to reaffirm the critical importance of universally available, robustly implemented, and—crucially—*highly performant* Patient Access APIs. These APIs, at a minimum supporting the USCDI dataset via FHIR, form the baseline for patient data access and application integration. Sub-par performance or unreliability of these APIs renders them practically useless. ONC certification must include stringent, real-world performance testing and consistent enforcement to ensure these foundational APIs are truly usable and meet the "without special effort" requirement of the Cures Act.

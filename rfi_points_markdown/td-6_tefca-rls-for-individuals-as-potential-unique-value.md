One of the most significant unique interoperability functions that TEFCA *could and should strive to* perform effectively is providing a **standardized, nationwide Record Locator Service (RLS)** that is readily and securely accessible to **individuals**.

Through their authorized and dynamically registered applications (as outlined in TD-1), patients should be able to query the TEFCA network (via their QHIN's IAS) to discover which participating healthcare organizations are likely to hold their health records. This function addresses a fundamental challenge for patients and app developers: efficiently identifying the source locations of a patient's distributed health data across the vast TEFCA network. While RLS exists for provider-to-provider exchange, making it robustly and easily available for patient-directed queries would be a unique and high-value contribution of TEFCA.

short_title: "Require Performance Parity for Open APIs"
summary: "As part of certification and information blocking enforcement, certified open APIs (especially Bulk Data FHIR) must be required to achieve performance levels (speed, throughput, reliability) comparable to any proprietary bulk or transactional data export/access mechanisms offered by the same Health IT developer or data holder. Lack of parity disincentivizes open standard adoption."

To further encourage the adoption and effective use of open, standards-based APIs, CMS and ONC should establish and enforce a **performance parity requirement**. This means:
*Certified open APIs, particularly for bulk data operations (FHIR Bulk Data Access) and potentially high-volume transactional access, must be required by regulation and verified through certification to achieve performance levels (including speed, throughput, and reliability) that are comparable to any proprietary bulk data export or transactional data access mechanisms offered by the same Health IT developer or data holder.*

If certified open standards-based APIs are significantly slower or less reliable than proprietary alternatives from the same vendor, it creates a strong disincentive for stakeholders to use the open standards, thereby perpetuating reliance on proprietary solutions and undermining interoperability goals. Performance parity ensures that choosing open standards does not mean accepting a significant performance penalty.

short_title: "Access to All EHI is Critical for Care"
summary: "Access to all EHI formats (scanned documents, faxed records converted to digital, free text notes, non-discrete data, alongside structured fields) is critically important for comprehensive patient care. It reduces diagnostic errors, avoids redundant testing/procedures, and lessens provider burden from data hunting."

It is critically important for healthcare delivery and interoperability that *all* data in an EHR system be accessible for exchange, regardless of its original storage format. This includes:
*   Scanned documents (e.g., old records, specialist reports from outside systems).
*   Faxed records (which should be digitized upon receipt).
*   Free text notes (progress notes, consults, discharge summaries).
*   Other non-discrete but clinically relevant data (e.g., some flowsheet data, PDF reports).
*   Alongside structured data fields (USCDI and beyond).

Accessible, comprehensive EHI is vital for:
*   **Patient Care Quality:** Ensuring clinicians have the full patient story to make informed decisions, reducing diagnostic errors, and avoiding adverse events.
*   **Efficiency:** Preventing redundant tests and procedures.
*   **Provider Burden Reduction:** Minimizing time spent hunting for information across disparate, non-interoperable sources or formats.
Limitations in accessing any part of the EHI create blind spots and inefficiencies.

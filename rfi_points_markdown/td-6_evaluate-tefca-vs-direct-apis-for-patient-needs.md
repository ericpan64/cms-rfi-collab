The unique value of TEFCA for *individual patient data retrieval* (beyond RLS) needs careful ongoing evaluation against a scenario where direct, performant, and universally implemented EHR FHIR APIs (including automated EHI Export) are available. TEFCA should not create higher barriers or offer less control for patients than direct access methods.

summary: "The EHI Export criterion is the current regulatory floor ensuring access to this full scope of data. Its utility is severely hampered by a lack of automation and inconsistent formats. Mandating an API-driven EHI Export request and retrieval process is key to making all EHI truly accessible for exchange and use."

The EHI Export certification criterion (ยง 170.315(b)(10)) is the current regulatory floor designed to ensure that all EHI, irrespective of format, can be exported. This capability is the primary bridge to accessing the "full scope" of patient data.

However, its current utility is severely hampered because:
*   **Lack of Automation:** Retrieval is often a manual, portal-driven process, not suitable for systematic exchange or application access.

Mandating a *standardized, API-driven EHI Export request and retrieval process* is key to transforming this capability from a compliance checkbox into a functional tool that makes all EHI truly accessible for exchange and use by providers, patients, and their authorized applications.

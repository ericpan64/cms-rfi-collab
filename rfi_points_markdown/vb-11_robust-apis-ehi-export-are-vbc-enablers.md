summary: "A combination of performant USCDI and Bulk FHIR APIs, alongside accessible and automatable EHI Export capabilities, are critical infrastructure components for successful VBC. These mechanisms are essential for comprehensive data aggregation, advanced analytics, effective population health management, and patient engagement strategies vital to VBC models."

To overcome the interoperability challenges hindering Value-Based Care (VBC), the following are critical infrastructure components and enablers:

1.  **Performant USCDI FHIR APIs:** For standardized, real-time (or near real-time) access to core patient data for individual patient care coordination and supporting specific VBC workflows.
2.  **Highly Performant and Reliable Bulk Data FHIR APIs:** Essential for efficient extraction of population-level data needed for VBC analytics, risk stratification, quality measurement, and cohort management. Performance must meet the demands of large VBC organizations.
3.  **Accessible and Automatable EHI Export Capabilities:** A modernized, API-driven EHI Export is crucial for VBC organizations to obtain comprehensive patient histories, including the "long tail" of data (notes, non-USCDI elements, legacy data) that is vital for accurate risk assessment and holistic patient management but not available through more granular APIs.

These mechanisms, when robustly implemented and performant, enable:
*   **Comprehensive Data Aggregation:** Combining data from multiple sources for a complete patient view.
*   **Advanced Analytics:** Powering risk models, identifying care gaps, and measuring outcomes.
*   **Effective Population Health Management:** Proactive outreach and targeted interventions.
*   **Enhanced Patient Engagement Strategies:** Providing patients and their VBC care teams with shared, accurate information.
These capabilities are not just beneficial but are increasingly foundational for organizations to succeed in VBC arrangements.

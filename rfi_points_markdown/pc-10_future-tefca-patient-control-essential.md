To empower patients and align with modern privacy expectations, TEFCA *must incorporate robust, patient-driven consent and control mechanisms*. This includes options like "Ask Me First" (requiring patient approval before their data is shared in response to a query) and a simple method to "freeze" or temporarily/permanently opt-out of TEFCA-based exchange. This directly supports the principle of minimizing application risk by ensuring patient intent governs network-level sharing.

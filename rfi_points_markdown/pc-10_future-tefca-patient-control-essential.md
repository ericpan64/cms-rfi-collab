To genuinely empower patients and align TEFCA with modern privacy expectations and principles of individual autonomy, the framework *must incorporate robust, patient-driven consent and control mechanisms*. These should not be aspirational future features but core components. Essential controls include:
*   **"Ask Me First":** An option for patients to require their explicit approval *before* their data is shared in response to a query through TEFCA. This allows patients to vet requests in near real-time.
*   **Simple "Freeze"/Opt-Out:** A straightforward, easily accessible method for patients to temporarily "freeze" or permanently opt-out of having their data shared via the TEFCA network.
Implementing these controls is crucial for minimizing potential misuse of data and ensuring that patient intent governs network-level sharing.

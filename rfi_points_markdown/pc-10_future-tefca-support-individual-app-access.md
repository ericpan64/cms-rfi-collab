For TEFCA to foster innovation benefiting individuals, its Individual Access Services (IAS) *must be designed to allow any patient-chosen application, including self-developed ones*, to connect and retrieve data on behalf of the patient. This requires QHINs to offer common, trusted identity verification and authorization management services that these diverse IAS-consuming apps can leverage, thereby ensuring individuals can engage in permissionless innovation within the TEFCA ecosystem, accessing their own data free of charge.

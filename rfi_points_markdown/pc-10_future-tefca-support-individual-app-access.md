summary: "TEFCA's Individual Access Services (IAS) must allow any patient-chosen application, including self-developed tools, to connect and retrieve data on their behalf, free of charge. This necessitates QHINs offering common, trusted identity verification and authorization management services for these diverse IAS-consuming apps."

For TEFCA to truly foster innovation that directly benefits individuals and empowers them with their data, its Individual Access Services (IAS) *must be designed to allow any patient-chosen application, including self-developed ones or niche tools from small developers*, to connect and retrieve data on behalf of the patient. This access must be free of charge to the individual.
To enable this securely and manageably:
*   QHINs must offer common, trusted services for identity verification (e.g., leveraging IAL2/AAL2 credentials).
*   QHINs must provide robust authorization management services, allowing patients to grant and revoke granular permissions to these diverse IAS-consuming applications.
This approach ensures that individuals can engage in permissionless innovation and utilize tools of their choice within the TEFCA ecosystem, without restricting IAS to a small pool of pre-vetted commercial applications.

Practices that may constitute information blocking include, but are not limited to:
*   Providing APIs (Patient Access, Bulk Data, EHI Export API) that are unreasonably slow, frequently unavailable, or consistently fail for compliant requests.
*   Failing to return all EHI that is electronically available and permissible to share under law in response to a valid Patient Access API request or an EHI Export request.
*   Imposing unnecessarily cumbersome, non-standard, or manual workflows for EHI Export when an API-driven process is feasible and expected.
*   Refusing to support or creating undue friction for dynamic registration of patient-authorized applications (especially those using self-signed certificates for individual patient access, scoped by a trusted identity credential).
*   Charging unreasonable fees or imposing discriminatory contractual terms specifically for the use of certified API functionalities for individual patient access.

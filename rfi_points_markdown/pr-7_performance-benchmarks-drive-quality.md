summary: "Establishing and enforcing clear, meaningful performance benchmarks for data access mechanisms (especially Bulk Data FHIR and the proposed API-driven EHI Export retrieval) within ONC certification will directly incentivize Health IT developers to build and maintain systems that make high-quality, comprehensive data truly available without undue delay or effort."

A key strategy for CMS to support providers is to work with ONC to *establish and enforce clear, meaningful performance benchmarks* for all critical data access mechanisms within the ONC Health IT Certification Program. This applies particularly to:
*   **Bulk Data FHIR APIs:** Ensuring these can handle large-scale data exports efficiently (e.g., speed comparable to proprietary exports, ability to export entire patient panels within a reasonable timeframe).
*   **API-driven EHI Export Retrieval:** Ensuring that the process of requesting, generating, and downloading a complete EHI export is timely and reliable.

When Health IT developers know their products will be tested against and must meet specific performance standards, it directly incentivizes them to optimize their systems. This, in turn, ensures that providers have access to tools that make high-quality, comprehensive data genuinely available without undue delay or "special effort," which helps mitigate their burden in data sharing and utilization.

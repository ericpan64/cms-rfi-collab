The most effective certification criteria and standards under the ONC Health IT Certification Program are those that move beyond validating the mere presence of a feature and instead focus on **real-world effectiveness and usability**. This means criteria that ensure:
1.  **API Performance:** Mandated APIs (Patient Access for USCDI, Bulk Data FHIR) are not just implemented but are also performant, reliable, and can handle realistic loads without undue delay.
2.  **Data Completeness:** Patients can access their *entire* EHI, through a combination of direct FHIR APIs for standardized data and a functional, automatable EHI Export mechanism for comprehensive data.
3.  **"Without Special Effort":** All certified capabilities, especially data access, can be used without requiring undue or unreasonable effort from patients, providers, or application developers. This includes clear documentation and standardized workflows.
4.  **Support for Patient-Driven Models:** Certified systems must fully support patient-driven dynamic application registration (using trusted identity credentials) and honor granular, patient-managed consent for data sharing.
Certification should act as a guarantee of functional, usable interoperability, not just technical compliance on paper.

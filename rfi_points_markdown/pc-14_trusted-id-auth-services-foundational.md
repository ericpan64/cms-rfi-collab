Robust, widely accepted digital identity credentials are not sufficient on their own. They must be coupled with trusted, independent services for *both identity verification (IAL2/AAL2) AND authorization management*. Applications should delegate these critical functions to such services (e.g., provided by QHINs for TEFCA, or other trusted entities). This approach, where apps don't manage credentials or unilaterally interpret broad consent, is fundamental to limiting the potential risk or "blast radius" of any single application.

If CMS were to establish any form of review or "approval" process for digital health products (even if just for listing in a directory or for specific program participation, not for clinical efficacy), the criteria must be sharply focused on:
*   **Transparency:** Clear, understandable disclosure of how the app will collect, use, store, and share patient data.
*   **Data Minimization:** Adherence to principles of collecting only the data necessary for the app's stated purpose.
*   **Robust Security Practices:** Demonstrated commitment to industry-standard security measures to protect patient data.
*   **Clear Privacy Policies:** Easily accessible and comprehensible privacy policies.
*   **Patient Control *within the app*:** Features that allow patients to manage their data within the application, understand how it's being used by the app, and easily revoke the app's access.
The focus should be on empowering patients with information and control regarding the app's behavior, rather than CMS making a judgment on the app's overall utility or health impact.

Given the public good nature of a nationwide provider directory with FHIR endpoints, CMS and/or ASTP/ONC should play a central role in its establishment and ongoing maintenance. Possible models include:
*   **Direct Publication and Maintenance:** HHS could directly host and manage the directory.
*   **Strong Oversight of a Designated Entity:** HHS could designate and provide strong oversight to a non-profit organization, a public-private partnership, or another suitable entity tasked with operating the directory.

Regardless of the model, HHS oversight is crucial to ensure the directory's:
*   **Accuracy and Completeness:** Processes for validating and updating endpoint information.
*   **Regular Updates:** Mechanisms to keep the directory current as provider systems and affiliations change.
*   **Public Accessibility:** Ensuring the directory data is easily accessible to developers and the public, potentially via its own API.
*   **Sustainability:** A funding and governance model that ensures long-term viability.

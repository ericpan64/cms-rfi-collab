short_title: "TEFCA IAS Must Robustly Support Patient-Authored Apps"
summary: "To fulfill its potential for individual access and offer unique value beyond B2B exchange, TEFCA's Individual Access Services (IAS) must be designed to seamlessly integrate with and support the patient-driven dynamic app registration model (as described in TD-1). This requires QHINs to use the patient's trusted identity credential to appropriately scope app access and leverage trusted authorization services, enabling true permissionless innovation for individuals within TEFCA."

For TEFCA to offer unique value for individual patients and truly foster innovation beyond existing Business-to-Business (B2B) exchange patterns, its **Individual Access Services (IAS)** must be architected to:
1.  **Seamlessly integrate with and robustly support the patient-driven dynamic app registration model** (as outlined in TD-1). This means enabling patients to authorize *any* application of their choice, including self-developed tools, to act as their agent for IAS.
2.  Require QHINs to leverage the patient's **trusted digital identity credential** (IAL2/AAL2) for strong authentication before any IAS transaction.
3.  Mandate that QHINs manage **granular, patient-controlled authorization** for these apps, ensuring that access is appropriately scoped and revocable by the patient.

This approach allows individuals to engage in permissionless innovation using TEFCA IAS, making the network's capabilities accessible beyond a limited set of pre-approved or commercially partnered applications. Without this, IAS risks becoming another walled garden.

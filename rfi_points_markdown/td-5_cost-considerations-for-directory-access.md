summary: "To encourage broad use and innovation, especially for patient-facing applications and individual developers, access to the nationwide provider directory (for discovering FHIR endpoints for individual patient data access) should ideally be free or at a minimal, sustainable cost to end-users and developers. Cost should not be a barrier to discovery."

Regarding user cost for a nationwide provider directory of FHIR endpoints:
*   For the purpose of enabling **individual patient data access** (i.e., apps used by patients to find their own providers' FHIR endpoints), access to the directory should ideally be **free** to both the end-user (patient) and the developer of the patient-facing application.
*   Charging significant fees for this discovery step would create a barrier to entry for smaller developers and innovators, and could indirectly impose costs on patients seeking to use apps of their choice.
*   A sustainable funding model for the directory should be devised that does not rely on per-query or access fees for basic patient-centric discovery use cases.
While some specialized or high-volume commercial uses of the directory might warrant a cost-recovery fee structure, the foundational use case of enabling patients to find where to connect their apps for their own data must remain unencumbered by access charges.

short_title: "Modernizing EHI Export: Mandate a Standardized API"
summary: "ONC *must* revise EHI Export cert (ยง170.315(b)(10)) to require a specific, standardized, FHIR-based API for programmatic EHI request, status monitoring, and download. This transforms EHI Export into an automatable, useful tool for comprehensive data access. #EHIExport #API #Interoperability"

Regarding the EHI Export capability (TD-11):

**a. Should this capability be revised to specify standardized API requirements for EHI export?**
Emphatically, **YES**. The current EHI Export capability critically lacks a standardized, API-driven mechanism for initiation and retrieval by patient-authorized applications. ONC *must* revise this certification criterion to require a **specific, standardized, FHIR-based API operation (or set of operations)** as detailed in the (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Automated, Standardized Retrieval of Complete EHI](#EHI_EXPORT_API)**) principle. This API must enable a patient (or their authorized app, leveraging an (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Assured Identity and Verifiable Authorization](#IDENTITY_AUTH_STACK)**)) to programmatically request the EHI Export, monitor its status, and securely download the complete package.

**b. Are there specific workflow aspects that could be improved?**
The entire workflow is improved by the API standardization: automation, transparency via API-based status monitoring, interoperable retrieval, and standardized error handling. Conformance with (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [API Performance Parity with Proprietary Data Channels](#API_PERFORMANCE)**) and validation through (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Certification for Real-World Usability: Validating Functional Interoperability](#CERTIFICATION_FOR_REAL_WORLD_USABILITY)**) are also essential.

**c. Should CMS consider policy changes to support this capability's use?**
Yes. CMS should:
*   Clearly articulate patients' right to use authorized third-party apps to invoke this standardized EHI Export API.
*   Consider failure to implement or performantly support this API as a potential (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Information Blocking Enforcement: Focused Oversight of Material Impediments](#INFOBLOCKING_ENFORCEMENT)**) issue.
*   Promote awareness of this enhanced capability.

Transforming EHI Export into an integrated, automatable component is vital for achieving (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Data Completeness: USCDI Minimum, FHIR API for Richer Exchange, EHI Export for Comprehensiveness](#DATA_COMPLETENESS)**) and fostering innovation.

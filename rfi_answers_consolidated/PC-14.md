Regarding digital identity credentials for patients and caregivers (PC-14), CMS and ONC should advocate for and support the national adoption of standards-based, interoperable solutions. This involves:

*   **Leveraging diverse, high-assurance credential options:** Including state-issued mobile Driver's Licenses (mDLs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and established services like Login.gov, all adhering to common profiles for interoperability.
*   **Integrating with standardized authorization protocols:** These identity solutions must be tightly coupled with OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and use FHIR Consent resources for healthcare-specific permissions.
This approach aligns with the (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Assured Identity and Verifiable Authorization](#IDENTITY_AUTH_STACK)**) principle, aiming to reduce fragmentation and enhance (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Patient Control: Transparency and Prospective Data-Sharing Preferences](#PATIENT_CONTROL)**) by enabling consistent, trusted credential and consent mechanisms across the ecosystem, including patient portals.

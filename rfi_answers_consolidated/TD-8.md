The most effective certification criteria and standards under the ONC Health IT Certification Program (TD-8) are those that prioritize **real-world effectiveness and usability**, as detailed in the (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Certification for Real-World Usability: Validating Functional Interoperability](#CERTIFICATION_FOR_REAL_WORLD_USABILITY)**) principle. This means criteria ensuring:

1.  **API Performance:** Mandated APIs (Patient Access for USCDI, Bulk Data FHIR) are performant and reliable (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [API Performance Parity with Proprietary Data Channels](#API_PERFORMANCE)**).
2.  **Data Completeness:** Patients can access their entire EHI via APIs and a functional, automatable (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Automated, Standardized Retrieval of Complete EHI](#EHI_EXPORT_API)**), aligning with (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Data Completeness: USCDI Minimum, FHIR API for Richer Exchange, EHI Export for Comprehensiveness](#DATA_COMPLETENESS)**).
3.  **"Without Special Effort":** All certified capabilities are usable without undue effort, including clear documentation and standardized workflows. This also implies upholding (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Patient-Authorized Access Parity (Portals and APIs): Ensuring Continuous Access Rights](#PATIENT_AUTHORIZED_ACCESS_PARITY)**).
4.  **Support for Patient-Driven Models:** Certified systems must fully support patient-driven dynamic application registration (using an (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Assured Identity and Verifiable Authorization](#IDENTITY_AUTH_STACK)**)) and honor granular (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Patient Control: Transparency and Prospective Data-Sharing Preferences](#PATIENT_CONTROL)**).
Certification should guarantee functional interoperability, not just technical compliance.

summary: "Information Blocking by tech vendors (e.g., poor API performance, incomplete EHI, app reg friction, unreasonable fees, obstructing portal RPA) must be actively discouraged. Link performance/completeness failures to info blocking, conduct audits, strengthen disincentives, and streamline complaint processes. #InfoBlocking #HealthIT #Interoperability"

Addressing information blocking (TD-18) requires robust policies and enforcement:

**Examples of Potential Information Blocking by Technology Implementation (TD-18a):**
Practices by Health IT developers or data holders that may constitute (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Information Blocking Enforcement: Focused Oversight of Material Impediments](#INFOBLOCKING_ENFORCEMENT)**) issues include:
1.  **API Non-Performance/Unreliability:** Consistently slow, unavailable, or failing certified APIs, violating (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [API Performance Parity with Proprietary Data Channels](#API_PERFORMANCE)**).
2.  **Incomplete Data Return:** Failing to return all permissible EHI via APIs or EHI Export, counter to (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Data Completeness: USCDI Minimum, FHIR API for Richer Exchange, EHI Export for Comprehensiveness](#DATA_COMPLETENESS)**).
3.  **Cumbersome/Obstructed EHI Export:** Implementing EHI Export with manual workflows instead of an (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Automated, Standardized Retrieval of Complete EHI](#EHI_EXPORT_API)**).
4.  **Barriers to Patient-Authorized App Access:** Obstructing dynamic app registration for individual use.
5.  **Unreasonable Fees/Discriminatory Terms:** Charging patients for their own data access via certified APIs, violating (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Zero Patient Fees for Individual Use of Exchange Pathways](#ZERO_PATIENT_FEES)**).
6.  **Obstructing Patient-Authorized Portal Access Tools:** Actively blocking tools like RPA when APIs are deficient, counter to (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Patient-Authorized Access Parity (Portals and APIs): Ensuring Continuous Access Rights](#PATIENT_AUTHORIZED_ACCESS_PARITY)**).

**Policies to Further Discourage Information Blocking (TD-18b):**
ASTP/ONC and CMS could:
1.  **Explicitly Link Performance and Completeness to Information Blocking:** Issue guidance that failure to meet (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [API Performance Parity with Proprietary Data Channels](#API_PERFORMANCE)**) benchmarks or provide timely/complete EHI Exports via an (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Automated, Standardized Retrieval of Complete EHI](#EHI_EXPORT_API)**) may constitute information blocking.
2.  **Proactive Audits/Testing:** ONC could proactively audit certified API implementations as part of ensuring (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Certification for Real-World Usability: Validating Functional Interoperability](#CERTIFICATION_FOR_REAL_WORLD_USABILITY)**).
3.  **Strengthen/Clarify Disincentives:** Ensure substantial and consistently applied disincentives.
4.  **Streamline Complaint Reporting/Investigation:** Enhance the Information Blocking Portal and ensure timely processes.
5.  **Increased Education/Outreach:** Provide targeted education on responsibilities.

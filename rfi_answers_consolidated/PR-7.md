To support providers in making high-quality, timely, and comprehensive data available (PR-7) and to mitigate their burden (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Addressing Provider Burden Through Technology: Designing for Clinician Efficiency](#ADDRESSING_PROVIDER_BURDEN_THROUGH_TECHNOLOGY)**):

1.  **Certification Must Validate Real-World Usability:** ONC certification must evolve beyond checkboxes to rigorously validate usability, actual API performance (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [API Performance Parity with Proprietary Data Channels](#API_PERFORMANCE)**), and data completeness (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Data Completeness: USCDI Minimum, FHIR API for Richer Exchange, EHI Export for Comprehensiveness](#DATA_COMPLETENESS)**) for direct APIs and automated EHI Export mechanisms (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Automated, Standardized Retrieval of Complete EHI](#EHI_EXPORT_API)**). This embodies the (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Certification for Real-World Usability: Validating Functional Interoperability](#CERTIFICATION_FOR_REAL_WORLD_USABILITY)**) principle.
2.  **Performance Benchmarks Drive Quality:** Establishing and enforcing clear performance benchmarks within certification directly incentivizes Health IT developers to build systems that make high-quality, comprehensive data truly available.
3.  **Robust Information Blocking Enforcement:** Consistent enforcement of Information Blocking rules (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Information Blocking Enforcement: Focused Oversight of Material Impediments](#INFOBLOCKING_ENFORCEMENT)**), especially concerning practices that impede API performance, delay EHI Export, or create undue friction for app access, is essential to ensure providers have functional, interoperable tools.

To advance patient access through TEFCA (PC-10), several evolutions are critical:

1.  **Address Unrealized Potential for Patients:** TEFCA's direct impact on individual patients (access, audit, control) is currently limited, with a primary focus on B2B exchange.
2.  **Mandate Patient Audit Logs:** TEFCA must urgently require QHINs to provide patients with clear, accessible audit logs of all queries and exchanges of their data via TEFCA, detailing who accessed what, when, and for what purpose. This is crucial for (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Patient Control: Transparency and Prospective Data-Sharing Preferences](#PATIENT_CONTROL)**) and transparency.
3.  **Enable Permissionless Individual Access:** Support a low-barrier, "permissionless" pathway for individuals to use their trusted TEFCA-conformant identity and authorization to directly query RLS and retrieve their own data from Participants (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Individual Access Parity within TEFCA](#PERMISSIONLESS_TEFCA_ACCESS)**). This also requires a universal (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Assured Identity and Verifiable Authorization](#IDENTITY_AUTH_STACK)**) within TEFCA.
4.  **Formal IAS Provider Role for Registered Apps:** Define a clear IAS Provider role where QHINs/Participants serve registered third-party apps, leveraging the TEFCA Trust Framework for identity and patient consent to access data network-wide.
5.  **Patient Control over B2B Exchange:** Provide patients mechanisms for transparency and proactive control (e.g., "Ask Me First," "Freeze" options) over TEFCA B2B exchanges happening *about them*, reinforcing (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Patient Control: Transparency and Prospective Data-Sharing Preferences](#PATIENT_CONTROL)**).
6.  **Complement, Don't Replace, Direct APIs:** TEFCA should complement, not supplant, direct certified FHIR APIs (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Prioritization of Publicly Specified Interfaces](#OPEN_STANDARDS_FIRST)**). If direct APIs offer better efficiency, patient control, or performance (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [API Performance Parity with Proprietary Data Channels](#API_PERFORMANCE)**) for individual data access, they should remain a preferred option.

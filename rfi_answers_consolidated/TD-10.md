To implement the Cures Act's API condition requiring access "without special effort" (TD-10), ASTP/ONC must ensure ONC certification strictly enforces this through a robust interpretation (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Certification for Real-World Usability: Validating Functional Interoperability](#CERTIFICATION_FOR_REAL_WORLD_USABILITY)**). This means certified systems must demonstrate:

1.  **PERFORMANCE:** FHIR APIs (single patient, Bulk Data) and the API-driven (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Automated, Standardized Retrieval of Complete EHI](#EHI_EXPORT_API)**) retrieval process must meet defined performance benchmarks (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [API Performance Parity with Proprietary Data Channels](#API_PERFORMANCE)**). Unreliable or slow APIs constitute "special effort."
2.  **DATA COMPLETENESS:** Certified systems must provide access to *all data elements* of a patient's EHI, aligning with (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Data Completeness: USCDI Minimum, FHIR API for Richer Exchange, EHI Export for Comprehensiveness](#DATA_COMPLETENESS)**). Failure to provide complete data is "special effort."
3.  **ACCESSIBILITY & USABILITY:** This includes clear, comprehensive documentation and full support for patient-driven dynamic application registration using trusted identity credentials from an (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Assured Identity and Verifiable Authorization](#IDENTITY_AUTH_STACK)**).
4.  **NO UNREASONABLE BARRIERS:** Absence of prohibitive (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Zero Patient Fees for Individual Use of Exchange Pathways](#ZERO_PATIENT_FEES)**) for individual patient access, no discriminatory contractual obligations, and workflows that are not unnecessarily complex.
5.  **UPHOLDING ACCESS PARITY:** When APIs are deficient, "without special effort" also implies upholding (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Patient-Authorized Access Parity (Portals and APIs): Ensuring Continuous Access Rights](#PATIENT_AUTHORIZED_ACCESS_PARITY)**) by not obstructing patient-authorized tools from accessing portal-visible data.

Effectively, "without special effort" means certified capabilities are practically usable without undue technical, administrative, or financial friction. Failures can be subject to (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Information Blocking Enforcement: Focused Oversight of Material Impediments](#INFOBLOCKING_ENFORCEMENT)**) actions.

A nationwide provider directory of FHIR endpoints (TD-5) would significantly improve access:

1.  **Enhances Discovery for Patient Apps:** A reliable (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Public, No-Fee Endpoint Registry](#PROVIDER_DIRECTORY)**) with validated FHIR endpoints (for direct EHR access and TEFCA QHIN/participant info) is essential for patient-app discovery.
2.  **CMS/ASTP/ONC Role in Oversight:** HHS should play a central role in overseeing or facilitating this directory to ensure accuracy, completeness, regular updates, and public accessibility.
3.  **Cost Considerations for Access:** To encourage broad use, especially for patient-facing apps, access to the directory for individual patient data discovery should be free, aligning with (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Zero Patient Fees for Individual Use of Exchange Pathways](#ZERO_PATIENT_FEES)**). Cost should not be a barrier to discovery.

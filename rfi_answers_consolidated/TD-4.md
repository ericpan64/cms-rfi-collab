To encourage use of open, standards-based APIs over proprietary ones (TD-4), CMS should:

1.  **Certify and Enforce Open Standards Robustly:** Continue mandating (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Prioritization of Publicly Specified Interfaces](#OPEN_STANDARDS_FIRST)**) (FHIR, Bulk Data, CDS Hooks, SMART, and a future (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Automated, Standardized Retrieval of Complete EHI](#EHI_EXPORT_API)**)) via ONC Certification. Crucially, (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Certification for Real-World Usability: Validating Functional Interoperability](#CERTIFICATION_FOR_REAL_WORLD_USABILITY)**) must ensure these are implemented to be performant (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [API Performance Parity with Proprietary Data Channels](#API_PERFORMANCE)**), complete, reliable, and supportive of patient-driven models.
2.  **Require Performance Parity for Open APIs:** Certified open APIs must achieve performance levels comparable to proprietary alternatives from the same vendor, as detailed in (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [API Performance Parity with Proprietary Data Channels](#API_PERFORMANCE)**). Lack of parity disincentivizes open standard adoption.
3.  **Aggressively Disincentivize Proprietary Lock-in via Information Blocking:** Use (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Information Blocking Enforcement: Focused Oversight of Material Impediments](#INFOBLOCKING_ENFORCEMENT)**) to penalize practices that favor proprietary lock-in by creating "special effort" for using standardized APIs or impeding patient-authorized app connections.

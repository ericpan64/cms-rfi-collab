To encourage patient and caregiver interest in digital health products (PC-5), CMS's role should be to:

1.  **Enable, Not Endorse Apps:** Primarily focus on establishing and enforcing a robust, secure, and highly performant data infrastructure. This includes universally available and reliable APIs (USCDI, Bulk Data (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [API Performance Parity with Proprietary Data Channels](#API_PERFORMANCE)**)) and an automated (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Automated, Standardized Retrieval of Complete EHI](#EHI_EXPORT_API)**). This empowers patient choice from a competitive market.
2.  **Set Baseline App Standards:** While not approving for efficacy, CMS could set/recognize baseline (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [App Transparency Criteria: Baseline Disclosures for Third-Party Applications](#APP_TRANSPARENCY_CRITERIA)**) (covering data rights, security, privacy) for apps connecting to CMS-regulated data.
3.  **Ensure Performance for Timely Access:** Mandate and certify for actual performance of all key data access APIs and EHI Export mechanisms. Effective (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Certification for Real-World Usability: Validating Functional Interoperability](#CERTIFICATION_FOR_REAL_WORLD_USABILITY)**) is crucial for timely, high-quality data access.
4.  **Foster Permissionless Innovation:** Champion policies enabling patients and hobbyist developers to easily register and connect self-developed apps to access their *own data* via certified EHR APIs and network frameworks (like TEFCA, per (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Individual Access Parity within TEFCA](#PERMISSIONLESS_TEFCA_ACCESS)**)), leveraging a strong (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Assured Identity and Verifiable Authorization](#IDENTITY_AUTH_STACK)**). This access must be free of charge (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Zero Patient Fees for Individual Use of Exchange Pathways](#ZERO_PATIENT_FEES)**).

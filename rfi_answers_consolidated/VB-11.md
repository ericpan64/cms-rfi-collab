Value-Based Care (VBC) program implementation (VB-11) is profoundly hindered by interoperability challenges, including:
1.  **Lack of Timely Access to Comprehensive Patient Data:** Fragmented records impede holistic views needed for VBC.
2.  **Inadequate Performance and Reliability of Bulk Data FHIR APIs:** Current real-world (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [API Performance Parity with Proprietary Data Channels](#API_PERFORMANCE)**) is often insufficient for VBC analytics, risk stratification, and quality measurement. This must be addressed via (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Certification for Real-World Usability: Validating Functional Interoperability](#CERTIFICATION_FOR_REAL_WORLD_USABILITY)**).
3.  **Difficulty Obtaining Complete Patient Histories (the "Long Tail" of Data):** Accessing critical information outside USCDI (notes, historical data) is difficult. A modernized (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Automated, Standardized Retrieval of Complete EHI](#EHI_EXPORT_API)**) is essential to address this gap for VBC.
4.  **Challenges with Data Normalization and Quality.**

**Robust APIs and EHI Export are VBC Enablers:**
A combination of performant USCDI and Bulk FHIR APIs, alongside an accessible and automatable (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Automated, Standardized Retrieval of Complete EHI](#EHI_EXPORT_API)**), are critical infrastructure. This aligns with the (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Data Completeness: USCDI Minimum, FHIR API for Richer Exchange, EHI Export for Comprehensiveness](#DATA_COMPLETENESS)**) strategy and enables comprehensive data aggregation, advanced analytics, effective population health management, and patient engagement vital to VBC models. These also help in (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Addressing Provider Burden Through Technology: Designing for Clinician Efficiency](#ADDRESSING_PROVIDER_BURDEN_THROUGH_TECHNOLOGY)**) involved in VBC data management.

Regarding Bulk FHIR APIs (TD-15):

**Increased use of performant Bulk FHIR is ecosystem-essential:** Robust implementation of highly performant and reliable FHIR Bulk Data Access APIs (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [API Performance Parity with Proprietary Data Channels](#API_PERFORMANCE)**) is fundamental for population health, VBC analytics, large-scale research, public health reporting, and responsible AI/ML development. These APIs, built on (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Prioritization of Publicly Specified Interfaces](#OPEN_STANDARDS_FIRST)**), are not optional for these critical use cases.

**Addressing potential disadvantages (challenges):**
Potential challenges like server load or managing large data volumes are primarily **implementation issues**, not inherent flaws in the standard. They are best addressed through:
1.  Strict adherence to and robust implementation of the FHIR Bulk Data IG.
2.  Clear, stringent performance requirements and testing within ONC certification (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Certification for Real-World Usability: Validating Functional Interoperability](#CERTIFICATION_FOR_REAL_WORLD_USABILITY)**), including ensuring (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [API Performance Parity with Proprietary Data Channels](#API_PERFORMANCE)**) (parity with proprietary exports).
3.  ONC-facilitated development of implementation best practices.

Diluting the Bulk FHIR mandate or accepting sub-par performance is not the solution; ensuring high-quality, performant implementations through strong certification is key.

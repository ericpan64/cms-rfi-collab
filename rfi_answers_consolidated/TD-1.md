To stimulate developer interest in building digital health products for Medicare beneficiaries (TD-1), CMS should:

1.  **Champion Trusted Patient Identity Credentials:** Actively promote and facilitate widely accepted, free-to-patient, high-assurance digital identity credentials, forming a core part of the (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Assured Identity and Verifiable Authorization](#IDENTITY_AUTH_STACK)**).
2.  **Ensure Free Personal Data Access:** Mandate that individuals accessing their own data via direct EHR APIs or TEFCA-facilitated individual pathways (e.g., (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Individual Access Parity within TEFCA](#PERMISSIONLESS_TEFCA_ACCESS)**)) incur no fees (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Zero Patient Fees for Individual Use of Exchange Pathways](#ZERO_PATIENT_FEES)**).
3.  **Ensure Robust API Performance & Reliability:** Universally available, highly performant, reliable, and well-documented APIs (USCDI, Bulk Data, and the automated (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Automated, Standardized Retrieval of Complete EHI](#EHI_EXPORT_API)**)) are critical. Sub-par (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [API Performance Parity with Proprietary Data Channels](#API_PERFORMANCE)**) is a major barrier. This requires rigorous (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Certification for Real-World Usability: Validating Functional Interoperability](#CERTIFICATION_FOR_REAL_WORLD_USABILITY)**).
4.  **Facilitate Granular Data Access Post-RLS Discovery (TEFCA):** After TEFCA RLS discovery (supported by a (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Public, No-Fee Endpoint Registry](#PROVIDER_DIRECTORY)**)), patient-authorized apps must use the same trusted (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Assured Identity and Verifiable Authorization](#IDENTITY_AUTH_STACK)**) to retrieve specific data via TEFCA individual access pathways, including potentially triggering EHI Exports.
5.  **Standardize and Mandate Automated EHI Export API:** This is crucial for unlocking comprehensive data (see **Cross-Cutting Principle: [Data Completeness: USCDI Minimum, FHIR API for Richer Exchange, EHI Export for Comprehensiveness](#DATA_COMPLETENESS)**) for innovative applications.
